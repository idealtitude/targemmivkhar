# targemmivkhar

**Targem Mivkhar**, it's Hebrew (תרגם מבחר), and it means "Translate Selection".

Go to this [Google Translate page](https://translate.google.fr/?sl=iw&tl=en&text=%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%92%D7%9D%20%D7%9E%D7%91%D7%97%D7%A8&op=translate) to read and hear the translation, so that you'll know how to pronounce this Hebrew expression.

## Presentation

This is an extension for Firefox that adds an option in the contextual menu and open Google Translate with the selected text... to translate it.

I made it because I was fed up to select and copy texts I want to translate, then open another tab and go to Google Translate, then paste the text, select the languages...

So I made this extension.

**Note:** in the current Firefox version I have, *132.0.1*, there's an experimental feature, available from the contextual menu, that does quite the same thing, except that it opens a popup and queries Google Translate to present a translation directly in the popup; plus it has several options and settings available.

If you're afer something more sophisticated than my poor little extension, then you'll probably be better to use that native Firefox translation feature!

## Features

**Targem Mivkhar** (from now on I'll call it **Targem** for short), has the follwoing features:

* [x] add an option to the contextual menu to translate selected text; the target language is English by default
* [x] an options page where you can:
    1. [x] Add any number of target languages from a predefined list
    2. [x] Add any language from a language abbreviation code (ex. "he" for Hebrew)
    3. [x] Choose in the contextual menu which of these target languages you want to use

## Installation

You can install the [targemmivkhar extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/targem-mivkhar/) from the Firefox Addons Page:

https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/targem-mivkhar/

You can also test the extension; simply follow the steps described below:

1. in FIrefox open `about:debugging` from the address bar
2. click on "This Firefox" tab on the left
3. click on "Load a temporary addon"

And you're done!

## Usage

Now you'll have the additional option in the contextual menu: *Translate Selection With Google Translate*.

To add other target languages other than the default English target, go the extension preferences where you'll be able to add and remove any languages you want.

## TODO's

Improve, enhance, beautify the UX for the options page.

## Contributing

If you like this small project and are intersted to contribute, you'll be warmly welcome! It's my first time creating and sharing a Firefox extension, and any help we'll be greatly appreciated.
